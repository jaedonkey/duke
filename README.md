# Team Development Notes

## Todo:

-Add GUI support for current implementation of Duke


## Note: When running implementation from this branch, please comment out the CLI loop or the GUI won't launch. This implementation is therefore solely for testing the GUI, until we find a way to integrate the both of them together.
